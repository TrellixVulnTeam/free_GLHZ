### Welcome to Minesweeper Battles!
A classic game of minesweeper but with 2 players facing off.

### Minesweeper Rules: 
- Each square will either be blank, a number, or a mine
- Left click to reveal a tile, right click to flag a tile
- You win when all of the mines are flagged (40)
- The number on a tile represents the number of bombs adjacent to that tile, vertically, horizontally, and diagonally (blank is zero)
- If you reveal a square that is a mine, your board will get frozen for 15 seconds 

### Joining a game:
You can either create or join a public room or a private room.
Pressing *Join* without entering a room code will automatically put you into online matchmaking with a random stranger on the internet. 
#### Create a private game
Alternatively, if you want to play with your friends, you can enter a private room.  
Each private room has an individual code, which other people need to join. 
Create a private room by pressing *Create a room*, and then share the room code with your friends so they can join. 
To join a room simply enter the room code into the search bar, and click *Join*. 

### How to play:
After the game starts, you will play on the board on the left. You and your opponent play identical games.

#### Green tiles
You'll be able to see your opponent's progress on the right through green tiles.
Each tile that they reveal and each mine that they flag will be green, the rest will be grey
This can help you, but it can also distract you from your own board, so use it wisely. You can also see how many flags your opponent has placed.
#### ❄Freeze!❄
If you reveal a mine, don't worry, it's not game over. A 15 second penalty and you're back into the game.
#### Winning
The game ends when one player flags all the mines, or if a player disconnects. After a game is finished you'll be able to join another game.
