        On the 21<sup>st</sup> of December, we woke up at four in the morning. It was a Tuesday. We ate breakfast and left the house at five. It was a cold morning so I wore a jacket. It was very dark outside, so it was hard to see what was around. We got onto the car and Uncle Khai Yang started driving us to the airport. I got to hear many songs on the radio when we were on the car. We parked our car in <a href="https://www.theparkingspot.com/" target="_blank">theParkingSpot's</a> parking lot. We later then got transported to the <span title="George Bush Intercontinental Airport (IAH)">airport.</span> We got on a flight to New York City. The flight was approximately three hours long. Unfortunately, I got a headache during the flight. We hopped on an Uber and headed for out <span title="Address: 121 W 28th St, New York, NY 10001&#010;Phone: (212) 564-2181.">hotel.</span> We later then started walking around New York City. We reached Times Square after quite some time and my legs were going to fall. That night, we ate some <span title="Ramen is a Japanese noodle soup. It consists of Chinese-style wheat noodles served in a meat or fish-based broth, often flavored with soy sauce or miso, and uses toppings such as sliced pork, nori, menma, and scallions.">ramen</span> that night, but I did not have my appetite. I felt better that night as I enjoyed the night and ate my (late) dinner.
