You and Amalgam chatted for a while, while the cake you baked earlier this morning was cooling. You challenged Amalgam to make a star themed cake and Amalgam took on the challenge. You gave Amalgam the book you borrowed earlier from the library and as he was working on the cake you called all your friends and asked them to come to the bakery. </p></div>
