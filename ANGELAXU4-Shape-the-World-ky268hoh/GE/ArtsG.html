  <td> <div class="CI"> <p style="font-family:'Courier New'"> You walked into the art store and went to the fabrics section and stubble upon your old friend from school Triangle searching for fabric. There is a piece of fabric that Triangle likes but can't reach and so you help her. Triangle is thankful, and insists that she buy something for you. However, you declined and you ask for Triangles contact information so that you can chat later. With that, you go your separate ways. Where do you go next with Semi? </p></div>
