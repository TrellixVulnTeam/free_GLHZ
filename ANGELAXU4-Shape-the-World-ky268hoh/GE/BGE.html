  <div class="CI"> <p style="font-family:'Courier New'"> Semi asked Amalgam if they needed help with the cake and they finished making the cake together. Once they finished the cake, Triangle, Square, and Rectangle all came in. They all sat down at a table and started chatting since you all haven't seen each other since shape school. While you are chatting you hear someone ringing the doorbell and you go see who it is. It's Heart and Diamond and they came because they needed to purchase bread. You gave the bread to them for free because they were the voice actors of your favorite game and you invite the both of them to stay for cake. They accepted you offer and everyone gathers around the counter to see the cake Amalgam as decorated. Everyone was astonished because of how pretty the cake was. You cut the cake, giving everyone a slice.</p></div>
