 <div class="CI"> <p style="font-family:'Courier New'"> You wake up from the sound of your alarm clock and wanted to shut it off to get five minutes of extra sleep but you realized your late for your job. You get out of bed, prepare yourself for the day and grab your keys. You head downstairs, keys in hand and open up your bakery. You begin by baking fresh goods to sell for the day and waiting for other shapes to arrive. As you finish baking the cake your cousin Semi comes into the bakery and seems to be sad. Semi mentions how they were busy last night with homework and rushed to come here to say good morning. </p></div>
