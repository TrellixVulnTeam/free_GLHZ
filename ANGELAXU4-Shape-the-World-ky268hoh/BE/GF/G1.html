<div class="CI"> <p style="font-family:'Courier New'"> You enter the game store, realizing how quiet the town is. You ask Semi if they found anything interesting. Semi tells you that they didn't find anything exciting and asked to leave. You told Semi that you'll catch him in a second because you have to get a gift for your friend. You bought the gift and then left the store. Where do you go now?
