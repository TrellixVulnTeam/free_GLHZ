Look at the comments in the FileProcessor class and the 
Cereal class to figure out what tasks to complete.  

In the FileProcessor class, you will fill in the processFile method that is 
intended to input the contents of the file and then create a Cereal object for 
each line in the file.  

Once the file has been input and the Cereal objects have been placed into a list,
you will explore the list and do common tasks like:
     find the Cereal with the most calories
     find the higest fiber:protein ratio
     find the average amount of carbs in Cereal
     etc....


Once you have completed this task, find another data set that you can download as
a CSV (or otherwise delimited) file.  Model that data as an object.  Find out
something interesting about that data set.  Be sure to pick a subject that is 
interesting to you!!!!!!!!
