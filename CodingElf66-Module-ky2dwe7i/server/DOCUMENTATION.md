## Math Pacakge

`Math` is a simple Python Package (supported in `Python 3.0`). It supports mathmatical functions, such as `addition`, `subtraction`, `multiplication`, `division`, `exponets`, `square root`, `factorial`, `floor`, `ceil`, `log`, `sin`, `cos`, and `tan`. This module can also determine if a number is a prime number (`is_prime`), and can also convert angles to radians (`angle_to_rad`). Anyways, let's jump straight in to this new package!

#

## Importing It

To import it, just put in the code below:

```py
from server import math
```

Or, if you want to import some individual modules, you can do the following:

```py
from server.math import <name>
```

Another easy option is to use the `--pip install <package>` version. If you don't have the `--pip install` command, install it first, and type the following into the Python Shell.

```py
pip install server.math
```
