# Idea
First, you must make a new repl.

Then, you unlock the editor.
Once you make 10 lines on the editor, you are able to make another repl.

Later, you get the upgrade where people code for you so all you do is make repls.

Finally, you get people to make repls for you, so you start posting them.

Posting them gets you more cycles, and much more than just making repls.

Finally, you are able to share it to the rest of the world once you have a big reputation (more social media).

Then, you are able to use the cycles to make a cycle bot to automatically generate posts for you.

You can upgrade the bot with... cycles
