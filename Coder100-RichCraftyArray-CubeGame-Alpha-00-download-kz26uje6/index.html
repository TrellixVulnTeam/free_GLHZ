    <h1>Cube Game!</h1>
    <p>Cube game alpha is out! We now have a 100x100 area players can explore!</p>
    <p>The generation is <strong>Very good</strong> according to me, competes with the top algorithms out there (totally original) and can compete with minecraft 1.18 generation!</p>
    <img src="img.png" alt="amazing 1.18 minecraft generation" width="500" />

    <h1>Installing (Windows)</h1>
    <p>Download the zip <a href="Builds.zip">here</a>. Unpack, and run the <code>CubeGame.exe</code>! Enjoy!</p>

    <h1>Faq</h1>
    <p><strong>How do I move?</strong> WASD to move, Space to jump, mouse to look around (you probably already found that out lol). Press esc to exit the game.</p>
    <p><strong>How do I know it is not a virus?</strong> Easy, just install it!</p>
