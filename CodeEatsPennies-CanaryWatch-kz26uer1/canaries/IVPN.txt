b"IVPN Warrant Canary\n===================\n\nOnce per month IVPN will publish a 'warrant canary' in the form of a cryptographically signed message containing the following:\n\n- A declaration that, up to that point, no warrants have been served, nor have any searches or seizures taken place.\n- Headlines from a major news source demonstrating that the update could not have been created prior to that date.\n\nSpecial note should be taken if these messages ever cease being updated, or are removed from this page. However this scheme is not infallible.  Although signing the declaration makes it impossible for a third party to produce arbitrary declarations, it does not prevent them from using force to coerce IVPN to produce false declarations.  \n\nThe current message is here:\n\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----\nHash: SHA256\n\nAs of 2021-12-03 no warrants have ever been served to IVPN or IVPN employees. No searches or seizures of any kind have ever been performed on IVPN assets. IVPN has no direct or indirect knowledge of any backdoors, or potential backdoors in our servers or network and IVPN has not received any requests to implement a backdoor. IVPN has never disclosed any user communications to any third party.\n\n(from https://www.ft.com/news-feed )\n\nEurope\xe2\x80\x99s far right seeks to form an alliance, yet again\nMeeting in Warsaw to include France\xe2\x80\x99s Marine Le Pen\n\nChina\xe2\x80\x99s Didi to delist from New York and go public in Hong Kong\nRide-hailing group\xe2\x80\x99s retreat following Beijing regulatory crackdown hits China tech stocks\n\nDidi\xe2\x80\x99s US exit shows Xi is the ultimate arbiter for China\xe2\x80\x99s companies\nRide-hailing app\xe2\x80\x99s pivot to list in Hong Kong seen as a vindication of president\xe2\x80\x99s crackdown\n\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\niQEzBAEBCAAdFiEEXxDK46RlUWr/x/EkisFrnrZHumkFAmGpuWoACgkQisFrnrZH\numkOJQf9H/qkrQ/o5rS7mbI4M0gr66S4EkzcyPT4FigBUsgCQZxylyqkK4jo2gqf\n1RsXZk18sTFBPzi3qF8L/AXbpqbn7WbX9qZubbiBm/VU3OgoOjOdQQuEAdPiYfRV\no/ZQrwQ8xUiveYAvJroZNuVLPTRA966cn/KVFql0OHXTWVe6AlIPvpZTu8z+LFfl\nY/5iTagOOKzPo3YEvWB0hUnX4L6lErlJxLqKMKakH6GZ/wH3k7i/Z1e/+Yo56HCp\nHYPVJbjJzkOX158g9kyBLs/QYJXE0NT1aVSa2UrUlE8QH0PXXe7p853x89l+eYvU\na2TE000RD2mQfW5mUAZyck9sqgpSVA==\n=a0n1\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n\nThe primary IVPN public key is here:\n\nhttps://www.ivpn.net/resources/pubkey.txt\n"
