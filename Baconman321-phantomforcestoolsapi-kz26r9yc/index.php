    <h1 class='title'>APIs for Phantom Forces Tools</h1>
    <p>This is where you can incorporate some of our features into your own website if you want. Note that APIs are subject to change. View out current APIs (for now we only have one, but that most likely will increase)</p>
    <h3>List of APIs</h3>

    <h3>How to use the APIs</h3>
    <p>Our API's are fairly easy to use, assuming you know how to use an API. We have a documentation for how to use each API depending on which one you want to use. If have never used an API before, or want to know how to incorporate it into your code, we reccomend you do a tutorial first. <a href='https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_ajax_intro.asp'>w3schools</a> is a great resource, as they have a tutorial on ajax.</p>
