I was playing Cookie Clicker the other day, and I forgot how much fun a Javascript game could be. Even without too much animation, Cookie Clicker is such a fun game! I thought, maybe using a bit of SVG animation and simple scripting, I could make a fun game too. It has been a while since I've invested this much time into a game, and I hope I can finish the idea.
