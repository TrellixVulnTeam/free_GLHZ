# G'day People!

Second week of school, done!
About 40 more to go!
Now I can relax in a weekend drowned in homeowork! (yay?)



Anywaysssss...

# Welcome to a tutorial on The Fibonacci Sequence! 

I will be covering who Leonardo Pisano Bigollo is, what one of his most famous work is about, and I've also included a quick repl where you can get as much terms (numbers) of the sequence you want! There will also be some interesting facts at the end.

All right, let's start!

***

## Leonardo Pisano Bigollo

Leonardo Pisano Bigollo was an Italian mathematician who lived from 1170 to 1250 (a longggg time ago!). He is best known thought as Fibonacci. 

His works include of course the Fibonacci Sequence, but he also introduced to the world math concepts like the Arabic numbering system, the concept of square roots, number sequencing, and also math word problems.

## The Fibonacci Sequence

The Fibonacci Sequence, named after the mathematician who discovered it, is a series of numbers. The next number is found by adding the 2 numbers before it.

The first numbers are:

`0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, etc.`

As you can see, the 3rd number in the sequence is `1`, made with adding `0` and `1`, the 2 numbers behind it. Then `2` is found by adding `1` and `1`. [...] `55` is found by adding `21` and `34`, and so on and so forth.


#### Golden Spiral

Now if we take the widths (the numbers) and make squares out of them, and then if we make arcs going from one corner to the other corner, we get a lovely spiral:


[image here]

As you can see, the first 2 squares in brown and purple have a width of 1, then the square in pink has a width of 2, next the square in dark blue has a width of 4, [...], and the square in red has width of of 34. Of course the loop goes on until infinty, so I havn't represented everything, but it's just to show the beginning. 

###### (and sorry it's not that precise, here is a better one from google:)

The important part of this spiral is that we can find it several times in nature:

#### Formula

First, we have to number the series from 0:

[image here]

So for example term number 0 is 0, term 1 is 1, term 7 is 13, and so on. 

This means that term 6 (8) = term 4 (3) + term 5 (5). We can represent it with a table with the first numbers of the Fibonacci:


[image here]

So now we can write the formula: 

[image here]

Now with an example, let's calculate term 10 (which is 55):

## Interesting facts

#### Multiples

Every 3rd number of the Fibonacci Series is a multiple of 2: 2, 8, 34, etc.

Every 4th number of the Fibonacci Series is a multiple of 3: 3, 21, 144, etc.

Every 5th number of the Fibonacci Series is a multiple of 5: 5, 55, 610, etc.

And so on and so forth.
We can sum this up with the following: every *n*th is a multiple of Xn.

To visualize this better: back to the table with the numbers:

[image here tableau]

As you can see, the 3rd number of the Fibonacci (starting at 1) is 2, and every 2nd number starting at 0 (2, 8, 34, etc) is a multiple of 2.

Another example: 

The 5th number of the Fibonacci is 5, and every 5th number is a multiple of 5 (5, 55, 610, 6765, etc.)

#### Fibonacci Day

Fibonacci day is November 23rd; if you write like this: 11/23, we get the first 4 digits of the sequence.

#### Miles and Kilometers.

Taking the first few terms of the sequence: 

`0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, etc.`

If we take 2 consecutive numbers, we get the 1st number in miles, and the second number the equivalent in kilometers (roughly):

```
0 mi = 0 km 
1 mi = 1.61 km â‰ˆ 1 
1 mi = 1.61 km â‰ˆ 2 
2 mi = 3.22 km â‰ˆ 3 
3 mi = 4.83 km â‰ˆ 4 
[...]
21 mi = 33.8 km â‰ˆ 34
34 mi = 54.72 km â‰ˆ 55
55 mi = 88.51 km â‰ˆ 89
etc. 
```

As you can see, each number is the sum of the 2 numbers before it. The higher we go, the more precise it is. 

#### Honeybee

This one's a bit more complex, but neverless still interesting:

> A more real life, found in nature example is the ancestral lineage of the Honeybee.

> In a Honeybee colony there are three types of bees:

> Queen Beeâ€Šâ€”â€ŠA single Female that produces eggs
> Worker Beesâ€Šâ€”â€ŠFemales that do work and produce no eggs
> Drone Beesâ€Šâ€”â€ŠMales that do no work

> â™€ Female Honeybees are produced from the Queenâ€™s fertilized eggs, so they have two parents, one Female and one Male

> â™‚ Male Drone Honeybees are produced from the Queenâ€™s unfertilized eggs, so they only have one parent, a Female

> When you trace back the ancestral tree of any Honeybee (Male or Female), youâ€™ll see that the number of bees in each prior generation matches the numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.

#### 1/89

The fraction 1/89 is about:

`0.01123595506...`

Notice how the first 6 digits (1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5).

However, if you write the fraction a different way:

```
0.0
0.01
0.001
0.0002
0.00003
0.000005
0.0000008
0.000000013
0.0000000021
0.00000000033
etc.
```

You see that the numbers at the end are the terms of the Fibonacci. However, they're overlapping; if you add those numbers above, you'll get an approximation of `1/89` (something like 0.011235955056179775.), and the more deeper you go, the more precise result you'll get, and therefore the more Fibonacci terms you'll get.

### The Program

#### Output

[image here]

So the program will ask you how many Fibonacci terms you want. Remember that if you enter a value too big, it'll take a pretty long time and it might crash lol. 

#### Code

The code is pretty straightforward, I also added comments so you can understand it better. I have the basic code, but also added some colors, and also a `try` and `except` in case the user types something else than integers, and also a `while True` loop so that it loops forever. 

First there's two variables `x1` and `x2` that have the initial value of `0` and `1`, respectively. Then there's an `input` to ask the user how many terms they want. Next there's a `for` loop that repeats for the number of times the user said before. 

Afterwards, there's a `print` statement that outputs the Fibonacci term (with color). Then, it makes a new variable called `next_x` which is the sum of the previous terms, `x1` and `x2`, like in the Fibonacci sequence. And then, `x1` becomes `x2`, and `x2` becomes `next_x`. This is to kind of "advance" the numbers; put all the numbers forward.
