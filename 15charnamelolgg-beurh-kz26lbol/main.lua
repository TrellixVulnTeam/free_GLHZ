stringg = "Hey, Vsauce. Michael here. This appears blue. This appears yellow, and this appears green. Those of us with normal color vision can probably agree. But that doesn’t change the fact that color is an illusion. Color as we know it does not exist in the outside world, beyond us, like gravity or protons do. Instead, color is created inside our heads. Our brains convert a certain amount of the electromagnetic spectrum into color. I can measure the wavelength of radiation, but I can’t recreate the experience of color inside your mind. So, how do I know that when you and me look at a strawberry, and this perception occurs [a red strawberry],which I call “red”, that in your brain this perception doesn’t occur [a green strawberry], which you have, of course, also learned to call “red”? We both call it “red”, we communicate effectively, and we walk away, never knowing just how different each of our internal experiences really were.\n\nOf course, we already know that not everybody sees color in exactly the same way. One example would be color blindness. But we can diagnose and discuss these differences because people with the conditions fail to see things that most of us can. Conceivably, though, there could be ways of seeing that we use that cause colors to look differently in different people’s minds without altering their performances on any tests we could come up with. Of course, if that were the case, wouldnt some people think other colors looked better than others? Or that some colors were more complimentary of others? Well, yeah, but doesn’t that already happen? This matters, because it shows that fundamentally, in terms of our perceptions, we are all alone in our minds.\n\nLet’s say I met an alien from a faraway solar system who, lucky enough, could speak English, but had never, and could never feel pain. I could explain to the alien that pain is sent through the A-delta and C-fibers to the spinal cord, the alien could learn every single cell and pathway and process and chemical involved in the feeling of pain, the alien could pass a biology exam about pain, and believe that pain, to us, is generally a bad thing. But no matter how much he learned, the alien would never actually feel pain. Philosophers call these ineffable raw feelings “qualia”, and our inability to connect words to these raw feelings, our inability to explain and share our own internal qualia is known as the Explanatory Gap. \n\nThis gap is confronted when describing color to someone who has been blind their entire life. Tommy Edison has never been able to see. He has a YouTube channel where he describes what being blind is like. It’s an amazing channel. In one video, he talks about colors, and how strange and foreign of a concept it seems to him. Sighted people try to explain, for instance, that red is “hot”, and blue is “cold”, but to someone who has never seen a single color, that just seems weird. And, as he explains, it has never caused him to finally “see” a color.\n\nSome philosophers, like Daniel Dennett, argue that qualia may be private and ineffable simply because of a failure in our own language, not because they are necessarily always going to be impossible to share. There may be an alien race that communicates in a language that causes colors to “appear” in your brain without your retina having to be involved at all. Or, without you ever having to see the color yourself. Perhaps even in English, given millions and billions of words used in just the right way, it may be possible to adequately describe a color such that a blind person could see it for the first time. Or, you could figure out that, once and for all, yes, or no in fact, you and your friend do not see the same red. But for now, it remains the case that we have no way of knowing if my red is the same as your red. Maybe one day our language will allow us to share and find out, or maybe it never will. I know it’s frustrating to not have an answer, but the mere fact that you guys can ask me about my internal experiences, and the mere fact that I can ask my friends, and we can all wonder at the mere concept of qualia is quite incredible, and also quite human. \n\nAnimals can do all sorts of clever things we can do. They can use tools, problem solve, communicate, cooperate, exhibit curiosity, plan for the future, and although we can’t know for sure, many animals certainly act as though they feel emotions: loneliness, fear, joy. Apes have even been taught to use language to speak to us humans. It’s a sort of sign language that they’ve used to do everything from answer questions to express emotion, or even produce novel thoughts. Unlike any other animal, these apes are able to understand language and form responses at the level of a two and a half-year-old child. But there’s something that no signing ape has ever done. No ape has ever asked a question. Joseph Jordania’s “Who Asked the First Question?” is a great read on this topic, and it’s available for free online. For as long as we’ve been able to use sign language to communicate with apes, they have never wondered out loud about anything that we might know that they don’t.\n\nOf course, this does not mean that apes and plenty of other animals aren’t curious. They obviously are. But what it suggests is that they lack a theory of mind, an understanding that other people have separate minds, that they have knowledge, access to information, that you don’t have. Even us humans aren’t born with a theory of mind, and there’s a famous experiment to test when a human child first develops a theory of mind. It is called the “Sally-Anne test”. During the test, the researchers tell the children a story about Sally and Anne. Sally and Anne have a box and a basket in their room. They also happen to have a delicious cookie. Sally takes the cookie and puts it inside the box, and then Sally leaves the room. While Sally is gone, Anne takes the cookie out of the box and puts it in the basket. When Sally comes back, the researchers ask the children where Sally will look for the cookie. Obviously, Sally will look in the box. That’s where she left it, and she has no way of knowing what Anne did while she was away. But until about the age of four, the children insist that Sally will look in the basket, because after all, that’s where the cookie is. The child saw Anne move the cookie, so why wouldn’t Sally also know? Young children fail to realize that Sally’s mental representation of the situation, her access to information, can be different than their own. And apes that know sign language but never ask us questions are doing the same thing. They’re failing to realize that other individuals have different cognitive abilities and can be used as sources of information. \n\nSo, we are all alone with our perceptions. We are alone in our own minds. We can both agree that chocolate tastes good, but I cannot climb into your consciousness and experience what chocolate tastes like to you. I can never know if my red looks the same as your red. So stay human. Stay curious, and let the entire world know that you are.\n\n And as always, thanks for watching.\n\n\n\n\n\nVsauce, I’m Jake and I’m glad you found me. I was worried I wouldn’t see you again before the bombs dropped. Things have gotten...out of hand. Ya know, it’s estimated that there are over 10,000 nuclear weapons in the world. 10,000. And depending on the size of the bomb, it could take as little as 2,500 to completely destroy all of North America and 13,000 more to destroy the planet. It’s beautiful out here isn’t it? Well, we should probably get inside and start preparing...come on.\n\nWe’ve all seen footage of nuclear bombs being detonated and it is jaw dropping, the force of it, the power. And we’ve seen the damage it causes to anything in the surrounding area. But we tend to forget just how devastating a nuclear bomb is, really. For example: Since 1923 there have been over 53,000 deaths from airplane accidents. There have been over 220,000 deaths from nuclear bombs, and that’s only from 2 of them. The shear amount of destruction and death that a nuclear bomb is capable of, created a new unit of measurement in the 1950s...a megadeath. 1 megadeath is equal to 1 million fatalities by nuclear explosion. To understand just how incredibly large and impacting one explosion would be, we have to look no further than the most powerful nuclear device detonated by the United States, Castle Bravo.\n\nCastle Bravo had 15 megatons of TNT and the fireball it created was about 4 miles wide. The mushroom cloud went 24.6 miles high and stretched for more than 60. But what we don’t see is what happens after the initial blast. Once the cameras stop rolling, it no longer exists for us but the effects of it are still there. In the case of Castle Bravo, two hundred billion pounds of coral reef and sea floor were ejected. A large amount of debris is pulled up and into the mushroom cloud, becoming radioactive, and creating fallout. As the cloud gets higher, the winds get stronger and carry the fallout away from the blast site, like radioactive seeds. Tiny particles of radioactive material can be pulled into the upper atmosphere and travel thousands of miles from the initial blast. The Island of Rongelap was 115 miles from the explosion and was evacuated 2 days after. White dust, fallout, rained down upon the inhabitants. They couldn’t return for 3 years and then had to leave again because the island still wasn’t safe.\n\nWhat’s scary about a nuclear bomb isn’t just the initial blast, I mean, that we can see. It’s the things we can’t see like the gamma rays or the radioactive dust that looks like any other dust. By the time you feel the effects of radiation damage nothing can be done to reverse it. Strontium-90, is known as a bone seeker and is released by thermonuclear explosions. It gets into the soil and is absorbed by the plants. Then by the animals that eat those plants, and then by the humans that eat those animals. Once inside it mimics calcium and starts to build up in our bones. Since it has a half-life of 29 years, it keeps emitting radiation causing bone cancer and leukemia. And, to me, the most unnerving part of nuclear war and fallout are the effects that are not immediate, that you don’t even know about until it is too late. Or that you don’t even know about because they affect someone further down your family line...after you’re already gone. There’s an obstacle course to recovery that survivors of large scale nuclear attacks face: 1-2 days — Blast and Thermal and then all the way to 2 to several generations with genetic effects When it comes to these bombs, the intent isn’t entirely just to destroy those within the blast radius or even those who die within a few days from radiation poisoning. The intent is to destroy everything they have ever known, to make their lives unlivable. As president Eisenhower said, “You can’t have this kind of war. There just aren’t enough bulldozers to scrape the bodies off the streets.”\n\nAnd there is actually something more frightful than actually detonating a nuclear bomb...the idea of detonating it. During the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union it was more about the capabilities and intentions the enemy thinks you have. It becomes a war of persuasion over a war of action. But there is another tactic, a doctrine of military strategy that boils down to if you shoot at me, I’ll shoot at you. But in this case, if you fire weapons of mass destruction at me, I will fire all of mine at you to make sure that neither side wins, that everyone loses. It sounds crazy doesn’t it? But it’s not crazy, it’s MAD (Mutually Assured Destruction). If something like that were to happen we could be safe in underground bunkers, with cans of food and our own water filtration system.\n\nBut how long would you have to stay underground? And would you even be safe there? Because you could always find yourself meeting a Nuclear Bunker Buster. I’m going to be honest with you...surviving a fallout isn’t really the question. Of course you could survive given the right preparations, humans are resilient and will perceiver through the toughest obstacles. A lethal dose of radiation wouldn’t turn you into a ghoul, it would turn you into a corpse. So the real question that you have to ask yourself in this situation isn’t if you could survive a fallout, it’s if you’d want to. I guess it’s getting to be that time. Einstein said something relevant to this.\n\nHe said “I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones.” Let’s lighten the mood a bit, shall we? Oh I love this one. This is “A beautiful Day” from Madame Butterfly, and in it, she is singing about a dream she had where she sees a puff of smoke on the horizon, and her future husband’s ship comes through. He arrives to rescue her, to save her from the life she’s known. Unfortunately, we will not be saved, we will not be rescued but I can guarantee that on that horizon we will see a puff of smoke. And, as always, thanks for watching"
